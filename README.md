# PicoMMU-bedslinger-compat
A collection of compatibility adaptations and user-level improvements for PicoMMU and related Klipper MMU tools, focused on bedslinger printers such as the Ender-3.
This repository does not replace or compete with the original PicoMMU project — it provides optional adjustments that improve reliability and usability on specific motion systems.

Included components:

PicoMMU bedslinger compatibility layer
Adjustments and fixes tailored for bedslinger (Y-axis moving bed) printers.

Filametrix Ender-series adaptation
A customized variant optimized for Ender-class machines.

Printer automation scripts
Helper utilities, including automatic shutdown and filament-handling scripts.

These resources are intended as community contributions for users who operate PicoMMU or similar MMU setups on bedslinger printers.
